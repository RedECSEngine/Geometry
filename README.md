# Geometry

Basic Swift Geometry structures with no library dependencies. Includes separate extensions for SpriteKit

## Purpose of this library
- Cross-platform Swift friendly
- Minimum geometry necessary to support needs of RedECS
- Focus on test coverage and readability over accomplishing the best performance for some functions. Performance can improve in time as test benchmarks are added and recorded, but thorough test cases should help make that migration easier without regressions.
